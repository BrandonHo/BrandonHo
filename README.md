<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm a postgraduate student from the Computing Science department of Nelson Mandela University. I'm currently learning about fullstack web development technologies, libraries, and frameworks.
I do, however, enjoy tinkering around with random aspects in game development and artificial intelligence. I also <i>REALLY</i> like mechanical keyboards ðŸ™‚.
